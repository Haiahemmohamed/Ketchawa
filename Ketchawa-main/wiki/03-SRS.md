1. The Minimum Viable Product What are the minimum functionality requirements for making this product? What features are absolutely necessary for this app to work?

- Users can select which shows they’re interested in.
- Users can listen to a playlist based on those selections.
- README.md (This is essentially to remind myself not to get lazy about the Read Me. They’re incredibly important if you expect anyone to ever look at or work on your project.
